    <h2> My bio:</h2>
    <p> "Hi, my name is Michael A. d’Amore. I am currently studying in the “ischool” 
        with a concentration in information security, web development and project management. 
        I am really interested in the intersection of IT and the automobile industry. 
        I am currently a student supervisor at SU’s makerspace. 
        The makerspace is a student run prototyping shop free for all students and staff. 
        My hobbies include racing, building cars, cooking, building computer and I love sports. 
        Last summer I bought a BMW fixed it up and sold it for a profit. 
        During the school year I am a mechanic on the Syracuse’s Citrus Racing team
        on the powertrain and aero departments. During my junior year I build a go-kart from
        scratch in my south campus dorm. I am the middle child of 5 and I have 3 nationalities (Italian, Spanish and American)"
