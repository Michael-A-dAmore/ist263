                    Some of us might remember what Schine was like before construction (and COVID). Now it's something completely new! Hereâ€™s what you can find in Schine:
The Intercultural Collective, a collocated space for the Disability Cultural Center, LGBTQ Resource Center and Office of Multicultural Affairs.
The Office of Student Activities with dedicated and functional work space for registered student organizations.
Schine Dining with brand new food options to try, including CoreLife Eatery, Panda Express and The Halal Shack.
Campus Store (formerly the Bookstore)
Fraternity and Sorority Affairs and Career Services will continue to operate in the Women's Building.</li>
